# Customer Churn Prediction (ML Project)

This project uses Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict telecom customer churn.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP
- Google Colab

## ðŸ§  Features
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- SHAP explainability for model predictions
- ROC Curve comparison

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for churn prediction.
Logistic Regression achieved the best F1-score for identifying churn customers (~0.56), while all models showed ~78% overall accuracy.
Identified class imbalance and recall trade-offs; considered improvements via resampling and model tuning.
